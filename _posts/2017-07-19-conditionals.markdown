welcome to my basic portfolio website!

#### the for loop ####
----

Simply defined using:
1. An initial value
2. A condition to check the value against after every iteration
3. An operation to perform after every iteration

{% highlight c++ %}

for( int i=0; i<10; ++i )
{
  // Logic goes here...
}

{% endhighlight %}

*As you can see it's basic usage is simple and easy to reason.*
